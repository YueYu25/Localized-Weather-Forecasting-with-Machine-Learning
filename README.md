# Localized Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning
This is code related to the paper "Localized Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning" from the University of Edinburgh.

The code mainly consists of four parts. Patch_Extraction.ipynb is mainly used to test the optimal patch size and verify the rationality of the selected patch size with a saliency map. GPU_Memory_Test.ipynb is mainly used to test the peak video memory required by the local weather prediction model and the global weather prediction model and the time required for a forward-backward training. Local_Weather_Forecasting_with_Pooling_Layer.ipynb is mainly about the experimental results of the local weather forecasting model using the pooling layer, and Local_Weather_Forecasting_without_Pooling_Layer.ipynb is mainly about the experimental results of the local weather forecasting model withoutusing the pooling layer.
